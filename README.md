## Intro

The NanoZK framework is a set of libraries and tools to help you write decentralized applications on top of a generalized zero-knowledge proof system. It is designed to make it easier to build privacy-preserving applications that don't require a trusted setup.

### Features

- 🎯 **Developer-Centric** - Superior developer experience with easy setup, intuitive API design, and detailed documentation, setting us apart from our competitors.
- ✅ **Highly Reliable** - Extensively tested to ensure it works effectively for complex computational tasks.
- 🧙‍♂️ **Privacy-Preserving** - Zero-Knowledge Proofs ensure that your data and computations are private and verifiable.
- 🐎 **Integrated** - Though it's powerful on its own, NanoZK is also designed to work well with other software and libraries for greater functionality.
- 🔋 **Batteries included** - Community and Core adapters

## Quickstart

There are a few [examples](https://nanozk.com/docs/examples) that you can use for playing out with NanoZK or bootstrapping your new project. For example, if you want a Next.js app, you can use the full-stack Next.js example:

**Quick start with a full-stack Next.js example:**

```sh
# yarn
yarn create nanozk --example nextjs
# npm
npx create nanozk --example nextjs
```

**👉 See full documentation on [NanoZK.com](https://nanozk.com/docs) 👈**
